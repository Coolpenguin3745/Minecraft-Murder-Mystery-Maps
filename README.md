# Minecraft-Murder-Mystery-Maps-and-Game-Information

A community project repository to add and have a bunch of Minecraft Murder Mystery maps for the Bedrock Edition so that everyone can easily get access to all the maps.
The maps are all up to date, with all the commands with appropriate roles, texture pack, chat-hider, and no name tags.
I want this project to be where people can add maps that they have, so everyone can have access to them. So if you have any maps please share.
I will have a video down below on how to add files to this project:

Video will be posted soon

# Rules and how to play Murder Mystery.

### How to play Minecraft Murder Mystery:

Each player goes through the Randomiser & gets a book.They must not read their book to anyone! If you're Innocent you must find & kill the murderer! But if you're the murderer, you must stealthily kill the other players to win! Don't trust ANYONE! They might be the murderer! If your play Murder Mystery 2, the same rules and way how to applies, but now if you get the Murderer book. You pass to someone else to be your partner.

### Rules:

1. Gamertags and
death-messages
are off

2. You don't
talk if you've
been killed by 
the murderer!

3. If all the
murderer dies, 
they MUST say
so

4. Everyone must
be able to
communicate to
each other


# Roles

There is a total of 18 roles. Here is the description for each one:

## Innocent:

The Innocent is a default player who tries to stay alive and find out who the murderer is.

## Murderer:

The murderer is the main killer role. Your goal is to kill all of the players without getting caught.

## Soul:

The Soul gives you a second life. You go through a timer and return as a soul, but you can not talk at all in your second life. On the second life you can not speak unless they are one of the final two or if they have the ghost role.

## Medium:

The Medium is an innocent role that can speak to the dead and ask them questions, such as when/where/how they died, or something like their role within 10 seconds.

## Altruist:

The Altruist is an innocent role that can sacrifice their life to bring back a dead player (not including the soul) in their stead. The person brought back to life can not speak unless they are one of the final two or if they have the ghost role.

## Detective:

The Detective is an innocent role that can investigate the deaths of players by asking for their killers in a message. The dead player will provide 3 names(2 if it's mm1), one of which is the real killer and the others being decoys. If the detective correctly eliminates the other names, they are allowed to kill their killer.

## Revealer:

The revealer is an innocent role that can pass their book to another player, and that person will message them their role. If it's a murderer, they can't fight until they see each other again. If the person they chose had their role changed, they would only message the original role. They are not allowed to say what role it is until after that person dies

## Assassin:

The assassin is a neutral role who has to kill one of two targets (usually the first unless they die or are the assassin themselves). They can only kill their target, and after completion, they are basically just a bystander who doesn't need to die for the main teams to win.

## Bodyguard:

The bodyguard is a neutral role who has a target they must protect. They can't just stick around them, but if they're attacked, you can assist. As long as your protected person stays alive after a murderer has died, you win, even if you die.

## Ghost:

The Ghost is a neutral role that has to get themselves killed and fake being alive. They can't kill or say that they've died. While pretending to be alive, other people can decide to vote if they feel there is a ghost around. If they vote correctly, the ghost loses, but if they vote incorrectly, the ghost wins. If they don't vote at all, the ghost also wins. The player who kills the Ghost, can not start or participate in the voting process.

## Lover:

The Lover is a neutral role that presses a button to decide who their lover will be. The two lovers must work together to survive until they get to the final 3, upon which they will win together. However, if one lover dies, the other lover dies too, unless it's a murderer or an active neutral killer.

## Doppelganger:

The doppelganger is a neutral role that can duplicate a role by passing their book. Once doing so, the doppelganger joins the other player in their role.

## Serial Killer:

The serial killer is a neutral killer who becomes active after a murderer has died. Once that happens, they become active and start killing everyone else in order to win.

## Necromancer:

The Necromancer is a neutral killer that kills indirectly. After a player dies, they become active and can choose to summon a dead player back to life to go through the necromancer timer and start killing everyone besides the necromancer in order to win. If the summoned dies, they lose, and if the necromancer dies, the summoned dies too. The summon can not speak at all unless they have the ghost role.

## Investigator:

The Investigator can message alive players if they've interacted with a dead person recently with. Only 3 uses per round

## Vampire:

The Vampire is a neutral killer who can turn people they kill into other Vampires once a murderer dies. Only the Alpha Vampire can turn people, and they all die when the Alpha does. Vampires can not speak at all unless they are the last Vampire or if they have the ghost role.

## Executioner:

The Executioner is similar to the Assassin in which they have a target that they must kill to win. They can only kill that person first unless they are attacked, and they can't kill until someone else dies. Once they kill their target, they act like an innocent for the rest of the game

## Thief

As the Thief, you take the role of almost any role you pass your book to.
If Innocent, you become their role and they become a regular innocent. If Neutral, you become their role and they become a Survivor who's only goal is to be a bystander and survive until the end of the round. If a Murderer or Neutral Killer, you don't become their role and the next time you see each other you will fight.
